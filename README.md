# CSProject_SurveillanceBalloonTracker
Project Description: Create a tool in C++ that will allow users to guess where a large high-altitude balloon might exist on a map. If the balloon is not in the randomly selected location, the application will identify which direction the balloon is. The user will continue guessing until the balloon is found.
